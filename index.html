      <h3 class="section-title fade-in">👨‍💻 Career Journey</h3>
      <p class="description fade-in">
        My career journey spans the intersection of product management, marketing, design, quality assurance, public relations, and human resources. I've not only navigated these fields but also brought them together seamlessly to drive innovation and deliver exceptional outcomes.

      <h3 class="section-title fade-in">✌🏼 Team Building</h3>
      <p class="description fade-in">
        Twice in my career, I've played a pivotal role in building teams from the ground up, helping organizations scale from 15 to over 50 employees. Using my network and people-first approach, I've attracted top-tier talent and fostered workplace cultures that thrive on collaboration, creativity, and mutual respect. <span class="highlight">I deeply care about people</span> and believe that when you care for your team, they give you their best. At the same time, I'm highly results-oriented, keeping my eye on ambitious goals while inspiring others to reach their full potential.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="section-title fade-in">🧠 Mindset</h3>
      <p class="description fade-in">
        I believe that <span class="highlight">cultivating better mindsets is far more important than simply hiring for technical skills</span>—because teams with the right attitude can conquer any challenge. My unique blend of technical expertise, creative vision, and strategic communication skills empowers me to consistently exceed expectations.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="section-title fade-in">🪄 Transformation</h3>
